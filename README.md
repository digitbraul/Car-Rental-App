# Flask Car Rental API
This is a proof of concept made for a SOA project-based class. It's barebones and was made purely for demonstrational purposes.
I might attach the project report and requirement specification for a more high level overview of the classes / SQL tables and how they interact.
This project uses the following technologies:

 - Python 3.12
 - Flask 3.0.0
 - Flask-RESTful 0.3.10
 - Flask-Marshmallow 0.15.0
 - Flask-SQLAlchemy 3.1.1

For a client-side app that consumes these API resources, along with session handling, check out [Android client-side app repo](https://github.com/digitbraul/Car-Rental-Android-Client)
